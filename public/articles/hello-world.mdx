# Hello world

## A new chapter

In this very first post, I’m introducing myself and kicking off my blogging journey! _Hello World_ is a classic starting point for every programmer, and for me, it marks the beginning of sharing my experiences and insights with the world.

This will be a space where I explore web development—trends, technologies, and beyond. I'm also thinking about expanding my focus towards full-stack development. My goal is to make each post unique, diving into interesting topics that inspire curiosity and provide valuable insights.

## A little about me

In today’s post, I won’t be diving into any technical details. Instead, I’d like to share a bit about myself.

My name is Kuba, I’m 25 years old, and for the past few years, I’ve been working professionally as a front-end developer, specializing in smart TV technology projects. However, my journey with programming began much earlier—at least 10 years ago, when I wrote my first object-oriented code in Java. It was during my studies, though, that I truly discovered my passion for this field, and since then, my enthusiasm for learning and growing in programming has only continued to grow.

In my personal life, I'm passionate about football and strength training. For the past few years, I've been trying to exercise regularly.

## Documenting my developer journey

I’ve been considering starting a technical blog for some time, and I now feel that the moment is right to bring this idea to life.

I feel that my experience is substantial enough that my reflections and advice will be helpful to other programmers. I would also like this place to serve as a form of documentation for what I'm currently learning, because after all, writing about something is the perfect way to learn it :)

Stay enjoyed!
